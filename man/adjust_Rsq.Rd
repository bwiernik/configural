\title{Adjust a regression model R-squared for overfitting}
\usage{
adjust_Rsq(Rsq, n, p, adjust = c("fisher", "pop", "cv"))
}
\arguments{
\item{Rsq}{Observed model R-squared}

\item{n}{Sample size}

\item{p}{Number of predictors}

\item{adjust}{Which adjustment to apply. Options are "fisher" for the Adjusted R-squared method used in \code{\link[stats:lm]{stats::lm()}}, "pop" for the positive-part Pratt estimator of the population R-squared, and "cv" for the Browne/positive-part Pratt estimator of the cross-validity R-squared. Based on Shieh (2008), these are the estimators for the population and cross-validity R-squared values that show the least bias with a minimal increase in computational complexity.}
}
\value{
An adjusted R-squared value.
