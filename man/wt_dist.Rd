\title{Weighted descriptive statistics for a vector of numbers}
\usage{
wt_dist(
  x,
  wt = rep(1, length(x)),
  unbiased = TRUE,
  df_type = c("count", "sum_wts")
)

wt_mean(x, wt = rep(1, length(x)))

wt_var(
  x,
  wt = rep(1, length(x)),
  unbiased = TRUE,
  df_type = c("count", "sum_wts")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector of values to be analyzed.}

\item{wt}{Weights associated with the values in x.}

\item{unbiased}{Logical scalar determining whether variance should be unbiased (TRUE) or maximum-likelihood (FALSE).}

\item{df_type}{Character scalar determining whether the degrees of freedom for unbiased estimates should be based on numbers of cases ("count"; default) or sums of weights ("sum_wts").}
}
\value{
A weighted mean and variance if weights are supplied or an unweighted mean and variance if weights are not supplied.
}
\description{
Compute the weighted mean and variance of a vector of numeric values. If no weights are supplied, defaults to computing the unweighted mean and the unweighted maximum-likelihood variance.
}
\details{
The weighted mean is computed as
\deqn{\bar{x}_{w}=\frac{\Sigma_{i=1}^{k}x_{i}w_{i}}{\Sigma_{i=1}^{k}w_{i}}}{sum(x * wt) / sum(wt)}
where \emph{x} is a numeric vector and \emph{w} is a vector of weights.

The weighted variance is computed as
\deqn{var_{w}(x)=\frac{\Sigma_{i=1}^{k}\left(x_{i}-\bar{x}_{w}\right)^{2}w_{i}}{\Sigma_{i=1}^{k}w_{i}}}{var(x) = sum((x - sum(x * wt) / sum(wt))^2 * wt) / sum(wt)}
and the unbiased weighted variance is estimated by multiplying \eqn{var_{w}(x)}{var(x)} by \eqn{\frac{k}{k-1}}{k/(k-1)}.
