These cover two axes of affective well-being, based upon dimensions of pleasure and arousal, and also reported competence, aspiration and negative job carry-over. Baseline data are presented from a sample of 1686 job-holders, and earlier uses of the well-being scales are summarized. The instruments appear to be psychometrically acceptable, and arc associated with demographic and occupational features in expected ways. For example, older employees report greater job-related well-being; occupational level is positively correlated with job depression-enthusiasm but negatively associated with job anxiety-contentment; depression-enthusiasm more predictable form low-to-medium opportunity for skill use and task variety, whereas anxiety-contentment is more a function of workload or uncertainty.

  title = {Using Interest Inventory Profile Elevation to Predict Depression and Anxiety in Individuals with Disabilities Resulting from a Personal Injury},
  url = {http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/etd/1675},
  abstract = {The present study was designed to address gaps in the literature, extend previous research, and increase current knowledge about interest inventory profile elevation as a construct. More specifically, the study investigated relationships between interest inventory profile elevation and depression, trait anxiety, and state anxiety. Age and cognitive impairment were also examined in these relationships. The sample consisted of 135 clients who sought services at a private psychological practice in central Florida during 2007 and 2008. The Self-Directed Search (SDS) was used to measure interest inventory profile elevation, which was defined as the sum of the six RIASEC section scores across the five sections of the SDS and includes interests and ability self-estimates. The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2) was used to measure depression (2-Scale), trait anxiety (7-Scale), and state anxiety (A-Scale). Trait anxiety was investigated with and without K correction. A client intake form was also used to collect personal and demographic information. There were two research questions posed in the present study: 1) What are the relationships between interest inventory profile elevation and depression, trait anxiety (with and without K correction), and state anxiety for individuals who have become disabled resulting from a personal injury? and 2) Do age and cognitive impairment influence the relationships among interest inventory profile elevation and depression, trait anxiety (with and without K correction), and state anxiety for individuals who have become disabled resulting from a personal injury?

Pearson Product moment coefficients found no relationships between profile elevation and depression, trait anxiety (with and without K correction), and state anxiety. A canonical correlation and hierarchical regression analyses found that profile elevation was not found to be related to the aforementioned variables by itself or in concert with other variables. These findings were not consistent with previous research, which found that interest profile elevation is moderately related to depressive personality traits. Results of the present study, however, found that cognitive impairment was the only variable that was found to be significantly associated with depression, trait anxiety with K, trait anxiety without K, and state anxiety.

Limitations, implications for counseling, and recommendations for future research were presented. Several ideas for how the findings from the present study can be used in practice were also included. The suggestions for future research would add to the state of the science in this area of counseling psychology.},

College self-efficacy was examined as a moderator of the relationship between Tellegen’s Big Three model and the RIASEC interest types. A sample of 194 college freshmen (i.e., less than 30 credits completed) was drawn from the psychology participant pool of a mid-sized Midwestern university. Instruments included the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) to measure the FFM; the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire Brief Form (MPQ-BF) to measure Tellegen’s Big Three model of personality; the College Self-Efficacy Inventory (CSEI) to measure college selfefficacy; and the Self Directed Search (SDS) to measure Holland’s RIASEC model of vocational interests. Findings from correlational analyses supported previous research regarding relationships among the FFM and the RIASEC interest types, and relationships among Tellegen’s Big Three and the RIASEC interest types. As hypothesized and tested via regressions for each of the six interest types, Tellegen’s Big Three model predicted all six vocational interests types (p $<$ .001 for all), while the FFM only predicted two types at p $<$ .05. College self-efficacy did not moderate the relationship between Tellegen’s Big Three and the RIASEC interest types. Implications and future research are discussed.},

Exps 1 and 2 indicated that LSE Ss sought the most social comparisons after receiving success feedback, whereas high-self-esteem (HSE) Ss sought the most comparisons after failure. Further results suggested that LSE Ss who succeeded were seizing a safe means of self-enhancement and that HSE Ss who failed were seeking to compensate for the failure. Also supporting this interpretation for LSE Ss was Exp 3, in which LSE Ss who succeeded sought the most comparisons when such comparisons promised to be favorable.

The occupational groups represented all six Holland types and encompassed both professional and nonprofessional fields. For over 80\% of the occupational groups, the highest GCT was on a scale matching the Holland code for the occupation. Likewise, the groups that scored highest and lowest on each GCT were consistent with Holland's theory. To determine whether the SCI can be useful in career assessment, it is important to show that the GCTs provide information that is different from the information provided by the Strong Interest Inventory (SII; Harmon, Hansen, Borgen, \& Hammer, 1994) General Occupational Themes (GOT), which also provide scores for the six Holland themes. Reports of career assessments with four college students in which both the SCI and SII were used are presented. They suggest that the SCI is useful in career assessment and counseling.},

In introducing and empirically testing an important new moderator of job attitude-behavior relationships, we shed some light on the historically elusive job satisfaction-performance relationship. We test our hypotheses regarding (a) the convergent validity of multiple strength operationalizations and (b) their ability to moderate job satisfaction-outcome relationships across six distinct samples, utilizing multiple operationalizations of both attitude strength and job satisfaction and examining multiple dependent variables of interest to job attitude researchers and organizational scholars in general (e.g., job performance, withdrawal). Results are supportive of our hypotheses, indicating that job attitude strength clearly moderates the relationships between job satisfaction and performance, withdrawal, and organizational commitment, but that not all attitude strength dimensions are created equal in this regard.},
